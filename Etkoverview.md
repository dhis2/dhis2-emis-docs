# **DHIS2 Education Toolkit**

Data dissemination and feedback to those who collect data is important to improve data use and performance at district and school levels. International reporting can often put pressure on frontline education officers and schools to report data upward. The toolkit has been designed with the aim that those who collect the data receive timely access to analyzed data, to address local challenges and data needs. The toolkit contributes towards cultivating a culture where data collection is not only for reporting purposes, but also for action.

## What is an implementation toolkit?

The Education toolkit is a collection of resources which can be customized to fit your needs. It is modular and contains a range of resources such as:

* Ready to use mockup forms, which can easily be customized to fit local needs
* Reference metadata SDG4 and selected CESA 16-25 indicators 
* Dashboards for SDG4 country benchmarks, country and subnational dashboards
* Demo instance with configuration, use of features, dashboard examples, best practices in DHIS2 design for data use

## Methods of adoption

The toolkit offers two methods of adoption:

1. **Dashboard only:** enables countries to exclusively implement the dashboard component while retaining their existing data entry form configurations.
2. **Complete metadata:** countries fully embrace the toolkit, encompassing data entry forms, indicators, and dashboards in their implementation.

## Resources

The toolkit is accompanied by a set of resources to support users through the adoption process:

* Design guide
* Installation guide
* Android and offline adaption
* Training material (Academy content, trainerâ€™s guides, webinars)
